# LearnTimeSeries

In this project, we will learn how to:

- engineer features to model the major time series components (trends, seasons, and cycles),
- visualize time series with many kinds of time series plots,
- create forecasting hybrids that combine the strengths of complementary models, and
- adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.
